<h2>Research Background and Achievements</h2>
<p>
  To realize useful quantum computation, it is essential to build a large number of reliable logical qubits.  
  However, the current level of quantum computers is such that even with thousands of physical qubits,  
  only a few tens of logical qubits can be obtained.  
  While this limitation partly stems from engineering constraints such as device implementation and stability,  
  even under an idealized setting of coding theory for quantum error correction,  
  there remain fundamental challenges in code design itself.
</p>

<p>
  Quantum Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes combined with low-complexity Belief Propagation (BP) decoding  
  have long been regarded as a promising approach.  
  Nevertheless, the following issues have persisted:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Low coding rate, leading to poor practical efficiency.</li>
  <li>Lack of sufficiently sharp threshold phenomena to dramatically improve error rates.</li>
  <li>Error floors causing performance stagnation in the high-reliability regime.</li>
  <li>A significant gap still remaining from the theoretical hashing bound.</li>
  <li>The necessity of high-complexity post-processing after BP decoding.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  To date, no quantum error correction scheme has simultaneously overcome all of these obstacles.
</p>

<p>
  By contrast, the field of classical error correction has already reached
  maturity. For instance, in mobile communications, LDPC codes have been
  adopted in the 5G standard, forming the backbone of real-world
  communication infrastructure. On personal computers as well,
  large-scale simulations with blocklengths up to \(10^7\) bits are
  feasible. While classical communication has achieved practical
  deployment of ultra-large-scale coding, quantum error correction codes
  are still far from reaching an equivalent level.
</p>
<h2>Our Research Direction</h2>
<p>
  We pursue two complementary lines of research in quantum error correction with LDPC codes:
  binary LDPC-based quantum codes and non-binary LDPC-based quantum codes.
  Both aim at scalable constructions and practical decoding while pushing performance toward fundamental limits.
</p>

<h3>Binary LDPC-based quantum codes</h3>
<p>
  In
  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08824" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
    Breaking the Orthogonality Barrier in Quantum LDPC Codes
  </a>,
  we focus on the orthogonality constraints between X/Z parity-check matrices, which tend to introduce short
  cycles and limit code distance and decoding performance. We control the commutativity of permutation matrices
  and restrict orthogonality constraints to the “active” part of the construction, while preserving a regular
  sparse structure. This yields explicit CSS LDPC codes with large girth, avoiding short cycles in the Tanner graph.
</p>

<p>
  As a concrete demonstration, we construct a girth-8, \((3,12)\)-regular \([[9216,4612, \leq 48]]\) CSS LDPC code
  and evaluate it under BP decoding combined with low-complexity post-processing on the depolarizing channel.
  The results show FER \(10^{-8}\) at \(p=4\%\), and density-evolution analysis estimates the decoding threshold
  at \(p=0.05702\).

<h3>Non-binary LDPC-based quantum codes</h3>
<p>
  In our

    npj Quantum Information paper
  </a>,
  we develop non-binary LDPC-CSS constructions and decoding methods that leverage larger field alphabets.
  The goal is to achieve strong finite-length performance with practical decoding complexity, especially
  in the low-FER (error-floor) regime relevant to reliable quantum information processing.
</p>

<p>
  Our decoding approach incorporates belief-propagation variants adapted to non-binary structures and
  explores post-processing strategies that account for degeneracy. The study reports performance
  close to the hashing bound under practical decoding, highlighting the promise of non-binary LDPC codes
  for scalable quantum error correction.

<h2>Q&amp;A (Frequently Asked Questions)</h2>

<h3>Binary LDPC-based quantum codes</h3>
<div class="news-item">
  <h3>Q. What do you mean by the “orthogonality barrier” in binary CSS LDPC codes?</h3>
  <p>
    A: The commutativity condition \(H_X H_Z^{T} = 0\) is essential, but enforcing it directly at the level of
    sparse regular binary parity-check matrices severely restricts edge placements. This tends to introduce many short cycles
    (especially 4- and 6-cycles), which reduces girth and hurts distance and BP performance. In our framework, the construction
    uses latent matrices that provide design freedom together with parent matrices, and orthogonality is enforced only on the
    active matrices (not on the parent matrices themselves). By controlling commutativity on the active part, we retain regularity
    while avoiding short cycles and achieving larger girth.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="news-item">
  <h3>Q. Can you construct shorter block-length codes to obtain convincing lower bounds on distance?</h3>
  <p>
    A: This is a very reasonable concern. At very long block lengths, it is often difficult to obtain solid lower bounds,
    and relying only on upper bounds can make it hard to judge how much the construction helps.
    Shorter instances would make it easier to compute convincing lower bounds and verify whether the distance is genuinely improved.
  </p>
  <p>
    The latest arXiv version includes a brief discussion of an idea to relax some construction constraints
    to target shorter block lengths while aiming to keep girth 8 and (hopefully) minimum distance 48:
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08824" target="_blank" rel="noopener">arXiv:2601.08824</a>.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="news-item">
  <h3>Q. How do you obtain large girth in the binary construction?</h3>
  <p>
    A: Avoiding only 4-cycles is not sufficient to unlock strong BP performance, so we also eliminate 6-cycles.
    In generalized Hagiwara-Imai codes with column weight \(\ge 3\), 8-cycles cannot be avoided,
    so girth 8 is the practical target in our setting.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="news-item">
  <h3>Q. Why choose a \((3,12)\)-regular design?</h3>
  <p>
    A: In density-evolution benchmarks, column weight 3 is the best-performing choice.
    Row weight 12 is the smallest value achievable by our proposed construction, so \((3,12)\)-regular is a natural design point.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="news-item">
  <h3>Q. What decoding method is used in the binary experiments?</h3>
  <p>
    A: We use belief propagation (BP) decoding with lightweight post-processing.
    In particular, we apply PP-flip and PP-OSD to correct residual trapping-cycle errors,
    improving the low-FER regime without heavy complexity.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="news-item">
  <h3>Q. What does the notation \([[9216,4612,\le 48]]\) indicate?</h3>
  <p>
    A: The “\(\le 48\)” indicates an upper bound on the minimum distance.
    This bound is derived from a potential (latent) matrix associated with the construction.
    Obtaining convincing lower bounds—especially at very long block lengths—is challenging and is a key motivation
    for exploring shorter instances.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="news-item">
  <h3>Q. What does the density-evolution threshold \(p=0.05702\) represent?</h3>
  <p>
    A: Density evolution tracks the message distributions of BP under the cycle-free (tree) assumption in the infinite-length limit.
    The threshold is the crossover point where BP transitions from successful to unsuccessful decoding on average.
    It serves as an analytical benchmark, not a finite-length guarantee.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="news-item">
  <h3>Q. How does this binary construction differ from earlier QLDPC constructions?</h3>
  <p>
    A: I am not exhaustively familiar with every previous construction, but from a performance perspective,
    our approach preserves sparse regular structure while controlling commutativity to achieve large girth,
    and it shows strong finite-length performance under BP with post-processing.
  </p>
</div>

<h3>Non-binary LDPC-based quantum codes</h3>
<div class="news-item">
  <h3>Q. What key idea enables the proposed codes to approach the hashing bound?</h3>
  <p>
    The construction cleverly exploits two well-known insights from classical coding theory:  
    (i) non-binary LDPC codes with column weight two tend to perform especially well under iterative decoding, and  
    (ii) column weight two allows flexible designs that can effectively eliminate short cycles in the Tanner graph.  
  </p>
  <p>
    By combining these properties with affine permutation matrix (APM) placements,
    the proposed codes achieve both orthogonality and large girth, which suppress error floors
    and enable sharp threshold-like performance.  
    As a result, the quantum LDPC codes constructed in this way approach the hashing bound,
    even at practical blocklengths.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="news-item">
  <h3>Q. LDPC codes with column weight 2 are known to have logarithmic minimum distance and poor decoding performance, aren’t they?</h3>
  <p>
    Indeed, classical binary LDPC codes with column weight 2 have a minimum distance that grows only logarithmically with respect to the code length,
    and their BP decoding threshold is significantly worse than that of column-3 codes.
    However, the situation is quite different for non-binary LDPC codes.
    When the code rate is high, the BP threshold of column-2 non-binary LDPC codes can approach the channel capacity,
    whereas that of column-3 codes becomes much poorer.
  </p>
  <p>
    Moreover, non-binary extensions can substantially increase the minimum distance,
    leading to performance without observable error floors.
    As mentioned in the following Q&A,
    it is well known in classical coding theory that good BP decoding performance
    does not necessarily require the minimum distance to grow linearly with the code length.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="news-item">
  <h3>Q. Is the minimum distance of the proposed codes large? If not, why do they still perform so well?</h3>
  <p>
    The minimum distance of our codes does not grow linearly with blocklength.  
    However, this does not prevent strong decoding performance under belief propagation (BP).  
    From the theory of density evolution, it is well understood that what primarily determines BP performance 
    are the column weight and row weight of the parity-check matrix, not the asymptotic growth of minimum distance.  
  </p>
  <p>
    Furthermore, it is known that classical LDPC codes with column weight three or larger typically have minimum distance 
    that grows linearly with blocklength when constructed at random. This explains why researchers in LDPC coding 
    theory tend not to emphasize minimum distance as the decisive factor: good iterative decoding performance 
    can be achieved without relying on very large minimum distance.
  </p>
  <p>
    While minimum distance is an important metric for characterizing the error-floor regime, achieving linearly growing minimum distance is not strictly necessary for excellent iterative decoding performance.
    This insight can be traced back to lessons from classical coding theory.
    During the 1980s and early 1990s, much of the community’s attention was directed toward the algebraic aspects of minimum-distance theory, and practical iterative methods received less focus.
    Consequently, the (re)discovery of turbo codes (1993) and LDPC codes (reintroduced in the mid-1990s, following Gallager’s original 1962 work) came somewhat later, even though their effectiveness derives not primarily from large minimum distance but from efficient iterative decoding and code structures that are well suited for BP.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="news-item">
  <h3>Q. What are the main components of the proposed coding framework?</h3>
  <p>
    The framework integrates four ingredients:<br>
    (i) Affine permutation matrix (APM) constructions to avoid short cycles,<br>
    (ii) joint belief propagation decoding over non-binary fields \(\mathbb{F}_q\),<br>
    (iii) optimization of minimum distance by carefully selecting matrix entries,<br>
    (iv) lightweight post-processing to remove residual errors.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="news-item">
  <h3>Q. How does the proposed decoding differ from conventional methods?</h3>
  <p>
    Unlike conventional approaches that decode X and Z errors separately,
    our joint BP simultaneously estimates both, fully exploiting the CSS structure.
    Messages are richer because they are probability vectors over F<sub>q</sub> rather than binary likelihoods,
    allowing more information to be exchanged during decoding.
    Residual trapping-cycle errors are corrected by local post-processing whose complexity is independent of code length.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="news-item">
  <h3>Q. What is the stabilizer weight?</h3>
  <p>
    The stabilizer weight is upper bounded by e × L, where e is the field extension degree
    and L is the row weight.
    For example, with e = 8 and L = 6, the stabilizer weight is at most 48,
    and crucially remains constant regardless of code length.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="news-item">
  <h3>Q. Does using non-binary LDPC codes mean we are encoding qudits?</h3>
  <p>
    No. Although matrices are defined over \( \mathbb{F}_q \) and decoding operates over non-binary fields,
    the physical system is still qubits.
    Each element of \( \mathbb{F}_q \) is expanded into an \( e \times e \) binary companion matrix,
    ensuring the code remains a binary CSS code.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="news-item">
  <h3>Q. How are orthogonal matrices constructed using APM (Affine Permutation Matrices)?</h3>
  <p>
    Our method generalizes the Hagiwara–Imai construction.  
    Specifically, we place affine permutation matrices (APMs) at cyclically shifted positions within the parity-check matrices.  
    By carefully choosing the shifts and the APM entries, the resulting non-binary matrices 
    \( H_{\Gamma} \) and \( H_{\Delta} \) become orthogonal over \( \mathbb{F}_q \).
  </p>
  <p>
    In other words, the inner product between any row of \( H_{\Gamma} \) and any row of \( H_{\Delta} \) cancels to zero in \( \mathbb{F}_q \).  
    After expanding each field element into an \( e \times e \) binary companion matrix, we obtain binary parity-check matrices 
    \( H_X \) and \( H_Z \) that satisfy \( H_X H_Z^{T} = 0 \).  
    This approach ensures orthogonality while avoiding short cycles, leading to improved decoding performance.
  </p>
</div>

<h3>General / Methodological</h3>
<div class="news-item">
  <h3>Q. Why is a new construction of quantum LDPC codes necessary?</h3>
  <p>
    Conventional quantum LDPC codes suffer from low coding rates, high error floors,
    lack of scalability, and heavy post-processing requirements.
    As a result, performance does not scale with blocklength and remains far from the hashing bound.
    Our work aims to construct codes with non-vanishing rate and efficient decoding
    that achieve performance close to the hashing bound.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="news-item">
  <h3>Q. Why do the results focus on large blocklengths?</h3>
  <p>
    Threshold phenomena and error-floor behavior become visible only at very large blocklengths.
    Demonstrating sharp threshold-like performance without error floors in this regime
    provides the strongest evidence of scalability.
    While short blocklengths also show good scaling, long blocklength results best highlight the theory.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="news-item">
  <h3>Q. Are measurement errors considered?</h3>
  <p>
    No. The analysis assumes an idealized setting where all gate operations, stabilizer measurements,
    and recovery operations are error-free.
    The purpose is to isolate the coding-theoretic limitations apart from engineering constraints.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="news-item">
  <h3>Q. How is decoding success or failure determined?</h3>
  <p>
    Decoding is judged by whether the difference between the true error and the estimated error 
    belongs to the dual code.  
    In other words, if \( (x + \hat{x}) \in C_X^{\perp} \) and \( (z + \hat{z}) \in C_Z^{\perp} \), 
    then the decoding is considered successful, because both correspond to valid stabilizers and 
    represent the same logical state.  
  </p>
  <p>
    If the difference vector is not in the dual, then the estimated error introduces a logical error 
    and decoding is considered unsuccessful.  
    Our framework also includes lightweight post-processing that can correct many failures by 
    resolving small trapping-cycle structures.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="news-item">
  <h3>
    Q. Could the unusually sharp performance curves be an artifact of incorrect decoding criteria?  
    For example, are you simply counting any error pattern that satisfies the syndrome as a decoding success?
  </h3>
  <p>
     In our framework, decoding success is not judged merely by reproducing the measured syndrome.  
    Instead, the definition is stricter: the difference between the true error and the estimated error must belong to the dual code.  
    In that case, the estimated error corresponds to a valid stabilizer and preserves the logical state, and only then is decoding counted as successful.  
    If this condition is not met, the event is classified as a decoding failure since it introduces a logical error.

  <h3>New Preprint on arXiv: "Sharp Error-Rate Transitions in Quantum QC-LDPC Codes under Joint BP Decoding" (July 16, 2025)</h3>
  <p>
    We have released a new preprint titled 
    <strong>"Sharp Error-Rate Transitions in Quantum QC-LDPC Codes under Joint BP Decoding"</strong> on 
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11534" target="_blank">arXiv</a>.

    This work reports the first observation of steep error-rate “waterfall” transitions in quantum LDPC codes with non-vanishing coding rate using 
    <em>binary</em> joint belief propagation decoding. This phenomenon was previously believed to require more complex decoding strategies.
  </p>

    The paper also investigates the cause of error floors, identifying trapping sets in the Tanner graph as key contributors. These insights enable the 
    potential design of codes and decoders that both maintain steep thresholds and reduce the error floor, moving quantum error correction closer to 
    practical deployment.

  <h3>New Preprint Published on arXiv: "Quantum Error Correction Exploiting Degeneracy to Approach the Hashing Bound" (June 19, 2025)</h3>
  <p>
    Our new preprint titled <strong>"Quantum Error Correction Exploiting Degeneracy to Approach the Hashing Bound"</strong> is now available on 
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15636" target="_blank">arXiv</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This work presents a decoding algorithm that explicitly exploits the degeneracy of quantum errors under the depolarizing channel. 
    Using non-binary LDPC codes and syndrome-based methods, the proposed decoder achieves a frame error rate of $10^{-4}$ at a physical error rate of 9.45%
    with a code of 104,000 logical qubits and 312,000 physical qubits, approaching the quantum hashing bound.
