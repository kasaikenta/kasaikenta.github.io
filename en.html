<h2>Research Background and Achievements</h2>
<p>
  To realize useful quantum computation, it is essential to build a large number of reliable logical qubits.  
  However, the current level of quantum computers is such that even with thousands of physical qubits,  
  only a few tens of logical qubits can be obtained.  
  While this limitation partly stems from engineering constraints such as device implementation and stability,  
  even under an idealized setting of coding theory for quantum error correction,  
  there remain fundamental challenges in code design itself.
</p>

<p>
  Quantum Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes combined with low-complexity Belief Propagation (BP) decoding  
  have long been regarded as a promising approach.  
  Nevertheless, the following issues have persisted:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Low coding rate, leading to poor practical efficiency.</li>
  <li>Lack of sufficiently sharp threshold phenomena to dramatically improve error rates.</li>
  <li>Error floors causing performance stagnation in the high-reliability regime.</li>
  <li>A significant gap still remaining from the theoretical hashing bound.</li>
  <li>The necessity of high-complexity post-processing after BP decoding.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  To date, no quantum error correction scheme has simultaneously overcome all of these obstacles.
</p>

<p>
  By contrast, the field of classical error correction has already reached
  maturity. For instance, in mobile communications, LDPC codes have been
  adopted in the 5G standard, forming the backbone of real-world
  communication infrastructure. On personal computers as well,
  large-scale simulations with blocklengths up to \(10^7\) bits are
  feasible. While classical communication has achieved practical
  deployment of ultra-large-scale coding, quantum error correction codes
  are still far from reaching an equivalent level.
</p>
<h2>Our Research Direction</h2>
<p>
  To address this situation, our research focuses on quantum error correction using LDPC codes,  
  particularly the construction and decoding of Calderbank–Shor–Steane (CSS) quantum codes  
  based on sparse binary or non-binary matrices.  
  Our aim is to design quantum codes that approach the hashing bound under practical decoding algorithms.
</p>

<p>
  One of our major achievements is the development of explicit quantum LDPC codes constructed from permutation matrices,  
  which demonstrate excellent error-correcting performance over depolarizing channels.  
  These constructions are carefully designed to avoid short cycles in the Tanner graph,  
  thereby suppressing the error floor phenomenon.
</p>

<p>
  We are also developing decoding algorithms that account for degeneracy in quantum noise models,  
  including syndrome-based decoding and belief propagation methods adapted for Galois fields.  
  Recent results indicate that combining dual codes with appropriate post-processing  
  significantly improves the decoding success rate.
</p>

<p>
  Through this line of work, we have attained performance close to the hashing bound,  
  reduced error floors in low-rate regimes, constructed codes with large cycle lengths,  
  and discovered binary LDPC codes with sharp error-rate transitions.  
  This research contributes to the long-term goal of realizing scalable and fault-tolerant quantum communication and computation.

<h2>Q&amp;A (Frequently Asked Questions)</h2>

<div class="news-item">
  <h3>Q. What key idea enables the proposed codes to approach the hashing bound?</h3>
  <p>
    The construction cleverly exploits two well-known insights from classical coding theory:  
    (i) non-binary LDPC codes with column weight two tend to perform especially well under iterative decoding, and  
    (ii) column weight two allows flexible designs that can effectively eliminate short cycles in the Tanner graph.  
  </p>
  <p>
    By combining these properties with affine permutation matrix (APM) placements,
    the proposed codes achieve both orthogonality and large girth, which suppress error floors
    and enable sharp threshold-like performance.  
    As a result, the quantum LDPC codes constructed in this way approach the hashing bound,
    even at practical blocklengths.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="news-item">
  <h3>Q. Is the minimum distance of the proposed codes large? If not, why do they still perform so well?</h3>
  <p>
    The minimum distance of our codes does not grow linearly with blocklength.  
    However, this does not prevent strong decoding performance under belief propagation (BP).  
    From the theory of density evolution, it is well understood that what primarily determines BP performance 
    are the column weight and row weight of the parity-check matrix, not the asymptotic growth of minimum distance.  
  </p>
  <p>
    Furthermore, it is known that classical LDPC codes with column weight three or larger typically have minimum distance 
    that grows linearly with blocklength when constructed at random. This explains why researchers in LDPC coding 
    theory tend not to emphasize minimum distance as the decisive factor: good iterative decoding performance 
    can be achieved without relying on very large minimum distance.
  </p>
<p>
While minimum distance is an important metric for characterizing the error-floor regime, achieving linearly growing minimum distance is not strictly necessary for excellent iterative decoding performance.
This insight can be traced back to lessons from classical coding theory.
During the 1980s and early 1990s, much of the community’s attention was directed toward the algebraic aspects of minimum-distance theory, and practical iterative methods received less focus.
Consequently, the (re)discovery of turbo codes (1993) and LDPC codes (reintroduced in the mid-1990s, following Gallager’s original 1962 work) came somewhat later, even though their effectiveness derives not primarily from large minimum distance but from efficient iterative decoding and code structures that are well suited for BP.
</p>
</div>
<div class="news-item">
  <h3>Q. Why is a new construction of quantum LDPC codes necessary?</h3>
  <p>
    Conventional quantum LDPC codes suffer from low coding rates, high error floors,
    lack of scalability, and heavy post-processing requirements.
    As a result, performance does not scale with blocklength and remains far from the hashing bound.
    Our work aims to construct codes with non-vanishing rate and efficient decoding
    that achieve performance close to the hashing bound.
  </p>
</div>


<div class="news-item">
  <h3>Q. What are the main components of the proposed coding framework?</h3>
  <p>
    The framework integrates four ingredients:<br>
    (i) Affine permutation matrix (APM) constructions to avoid short cycles,<br>
    (ii) joint belief propagation decoding over non-binary fields F<sub>q</sub>,<br>
    (iii) optimization of minimum distance by carefully selecting matrix entries,<br>
    (iv) lightweight post-processing to remove residual errors.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="news-item">
  <h3>Q. How does the proposed decoding differ from conventional methods?</h3>
  <p>
    Unlike conventional approaches that decode X and Z errors separately,
    our joint BP simultaneously estimates both, fully exploiting the CSS structure.
    Messages are richer because they are probability vectors over F<sub>q</sub> rather than binary likelihoods,
    allowing more information to be exchanged during decoding.
    Residual trapping-cycle errors are corrected by local post-processing whose complexity is independent of code length.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="news-item">
  <h3>Q. Why do the results focus on large blocklengths?</h3>
  <p>
    Threshold phenomena and error-floor behavior become visible only at very large blocklengths.
    Demonstrating sharp threshold-like performance without error floors in this regime
    provides the strongest evidence of scalability.
    While short blocklengths also show good scaling, long blocklength results best highlight the theory.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="news-item">
  <h3>Q. What is the stabilizer weight?</h3>
  <p>
    The stabilizer weight is upper bounded by e × L, where e is the field extension degree
    and L is the row weight.
    For example, with e = 8 and L = 6, the stabilizer weight is at most 48,
    and crucially remains constant regardless of code length.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="news-item">
  <h3>Q. Are measurement errors considered?</h3>
  <p>
    No. The analysis assumes an idealized setting where all gate operations, stabilizer measurements,
    and recovery operations are error-free.
    The purpose is to isolate the coding-theoretic limitations apart from engineering constraints.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="news-item">
  <h3>Q. Does using non-binary LDPC codes mean we are encoding qudits?</h3>
  <p>
    No. Although matrices are defined over \( F_q \) and decoding operates over non-binary fields,
    the physical system is still qubits.
    Each element of \( F_q \) is expanded into an \( e \times e \) binary companion matrix,
    ensuring the code remains a binary CSS code.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="news-item">
  <h3>Q. How is decoding success or failure determined?</h3>
  <p>
    Decoding is judged by whether the difference between the true error and the estimated error 
    belongs to the dual code.  
    In other words, if \( (x + \hat{x}) \in C_X^{\perp} \) and \( (z + \hat{z}) \in C_Z^{\perp} \), 
    then the decoding is considered successful, because both correspond to valid stabilizers and 
    represent the same logical state.  
  </p>
  <p>
    If the difference vector is not in the dual, then the estimated error introduces a logical error 
    and decoding is considered unsuccessful.  
    Our framework also includes lightweight post-processing that can correct many failures by 
    resolving small trapping-cycle structures.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="news-item">
  <h3>Q. How are orthogonal matrices constructed using APM (Affine Permutation Matrices)?</h3>
  <p>
    Our method generalizes the Hagiwara–Imai construction.  
    Specifically, we place affine permutation matrices (APMs) at cyclically shifted positions within the parity-check matrices.  
    By carefully choosing the shifts and the APM entries, the resulting non-binary matrices 
    \( H_{\Gamma} \) and \( H_{\Delta} \) become orthogonal over \( F_q \).
  </p>
  <p>
    In other words, the inner product between any row of \( H_{\Gamma} \) and any row of \( H_{\Delta} \) cancels to zero in \( F_q \).  
    After expanding each field element into an \( e \times e \) binary companion matrix, we obtain binary parity-check matrices 
    \( H_X \) and \( H_Z \) that satisfy \( H_X H_Z^{T} = 0 \).  
    This approach ensures orthogonality while avoiding short cycles, leading to improved decoding performance.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="news-item">
  <h3>
    Q. Could the unusually sharp performance curves be an artifact of incorrect decoding criteria?  
    For example, are you simply counting any error pattern that satisfies the syndrome as a decoding success?
  </h3>
  <p>
     In our framework, decoding success is not judged merely by reproducing the measured syndrome.  
    Instead, the definition is stricter: the difference between the true error and the estimated error must belong to the dual code.  
    In that case, the estimated error corresponds to a valid stabilizer and preserves the logical state, and only then is decoding counted as successful.  
    If this condition is not met, the event is classified as a decoding failure since it introduces a logical error.

  <h3>New Preprint on arXiv: "Sharp Error-Rate Transitions in Quantum QC-LDPC Codes under Joint BP Decoding" (July 16, 2025)</h3>
  <p>
    We have released a new preprint titled 
    <strong>"Sharp Error-Rate Transitions in Quantum QC-LDPC Codes under Joint BP Decoding"</strong> on 
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11534" target="_blank">arXiv</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This work reports the first observation of steep error-rate “waterfall” transitions in quantum LDPC codes with non-vanishing coding rate using 
    <em>binary</em> joint belief propagation decoding. This phenomenon was previously believed to require more complex decoding strategies.
  </p>
  <p>
    The paper also investigates the cause of error floors, identifying trapping sets in the Tanner graph as key contributors. These insights enable the 
    potential design of codes and decoders that both maintain steep thresholds and reduce the error floor, moving quantum error correction closer to 
    practical deployment.
