  <h2>Recent Research</h2>
  <p>
    My recent research focuses on quantum error correction using low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, 
    particularly the construction and decoding of Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) quantum codes based on sparse binary or non-binary matrices.
    We aim to design quantum codes that approach the hashing bound under practical decoding algorithms.
  </p>

  <p>
    One of our major achievements is the development of explicit quantum LDPC codes constructed from permutation matrices,
    which demonstrate excellent error-correcting performance over depolarizing channels.
    These constructions are designed to avoid short cycles in the Tanner graph to suppress the error floor phenomenon.
  </p>

  <p>
    We are also working on decoding algorithms that handle degeneracy in quantum noise models, 
    including syndrome-based decoding and belief propagation methods adapted for Galois fields.
    Recent results suggest that combining dual codes with appropriate post-processing significantly improves the decoding success rate.
  </p>

  <p>
    This line of work contributes to the long-term goal of realizing scalable and fault-tolerant quantum communication and computation.

  <h3>New Preprint on arXiv: "Sharp Error-Rate Transitions in Quantum QC-LDPC Codes under Joint BP Decoding" (July 16, 2025)</h3>
  <p>
    We have released a new preprint titled 
    <strong>"Sharp Error-Rate Transitions in Quantum QC-LDPC Codes under Joint BP Decoding"</strong> on 
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11534" target="_blank">arXiv</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This work reports the first observation of steep error-rate “waterfall” transitions in quantum LDPC codes with non-vanishing coding rate using 
    <em>binary</em> joint belief propagation decoding. This phenomenon was previously believed to require more complex decoding strategies.
  </p>
  <p>
    The paper also investigates the cause of error floors, identifying trapping sets in the Tanner graph as key contributors. These insights enable the 
    potential design of codes and decoders that both maintain steep thresholds and reduce the error floor, moving quantum error correction closer to 
    practical deployment.

  <h3>New Preprint Published on arXiv: "Quantum Error Correction Exploiting Degeneracy to Approach the Hashing Bound" (June 19, 2025)</h3>
  <p>
    Our new preprint titled <strong>"Quantum Error Correction Exploiting Degeneracy to Approach the Hashing Bound"</strong> is now available on 
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15636" target="_blank">arXiv</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This work presents a decoding algorithm that explicitly exploits the degeneracy of quantum errors under the depolarizing channel. 
    Using non-binary LDPC codes and syndrome-based methods, the proposed decoder achieves a frame error rate of $10^{-4}$ at a physical error rate of 9.45%
    with a code of 104,000 logical qubits and 312,000 physical qubits, approaching the quantum hashing bound.
